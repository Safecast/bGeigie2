## TODO

* Add pull-up/down for important connections
  - done for SD, GPS
  - in principle, done for radio too, but check more datasheet
* Add audio jack 3.5mm (+direct solder holes) with pull-down resistor!
* Add holes for high voltage power supply board
* Add some status LEDs (from 1284p digital pin, optional)
* Replace big SD card by micro SD card
* Replace HT77XXA by MAX1624 (?)
* Breakout pins from 32u4

* Finish BOM

## Before manufacturing

* Check all footprints
* Source components
