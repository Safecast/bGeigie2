## TODO

* Add temperature sensor
* Add antenna connectors (both GPS and radio)
* Add battery connectors
* Add Battery sensing circuitry
* Add line between Atmega32u4 and Atmega1284p
* Check how the SPI stuff will playout between the two ICS 
  (2 masters, connected to SD card), we might need to be able to power them independently
* Add the 5V boost converter for the High Voltage Power supply


## Before manufacturing

* Check all footprints
* Source components
